Update the existing portfolio website code. Remove the animated moving stars or particle background from the hero section (or any other section) while keeping all other design elements, dark theme, animations, and layout intact.

Ensure the hero section still has a dark background (#121212 or #1e1e1e).

Keep all text, buttons, scroll animations, hover effects, and other interactive elements as they are.

Remove only the particle or moving star animation code (like particles.js, tsParticles, or custom CSS/JS animations) completely.
